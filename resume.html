        <B>INTERNSHIP PROJECT CAREER ASPIRATION SURVEY ANALYSIS</B>
        <P>
            An analysis of career aspirations using Python can be a valuable project that helps individuals gain
            insights into their professional goals and the steps needed to achieve them.
            It involves using programming and data analysis techniques to gain insights into various aspects of one's
            career, such as skills, job market trends, salary prospects, and more.
            Python is a powerful tool for this purpose due to its versatility in handling data and its wide range of
            libraries and frameworks for data analysis and visualization.

        <B>PROJECT 1:REAL TIME CLOCK USING LPC1768</B>
        <P>
            The above mention project is about Real-time Clock (RTC) component provides accurate time and date
            information with high accuracy in various electronic systems.
            The time and date are updated every second based on a one pulse per second interrupt from a 32.768-k-Hz
            crystal. Clock accuracy is based on the crystal provided and is typically 20 ppm.
        </P>
        <B>PROJECT 2:SMART GLOVES FOR DEAF AND DUMB</B>
        <P>
            In this project, mainly used Arduino uno, Flex Sensors, Power supply, Speaker, Recorder and playback ,Lcd
            Display.
            The no. of disabled people like deaf and dumb are increasing day by day. When a speech impaired person
            speaks to a normal person,
            the normal person find it difficult to understand and asks the deaf-dumb person to show gestures for their
            needs.
            So the device help them to live a free life in the society without the help of a third person.
